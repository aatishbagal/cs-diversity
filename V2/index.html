            <br>
            <p style="font-size: x-large;">
                Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems or machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

            <h2>What is AI Used for?</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: x-large">
                AI has found applications across various domains, including healthcare (diagnosis and treatment recommendations), finance (fraud detection and algorithmic trading), education (personalized learning), manufacturing (robotics and automation), and entertainment (video game AI and content recommendation).

                    As we write algorithms, our biases inherently show up in the decisions we make about how to design the algorithm or what and how data sets are used, and then these biases can get reified in the technology that we produce. A lot of AI tools are driven by data, and data comes from society, which has its own built-in biases.

                <P style="font-size:x-large;">
                    It’s incredibly important to have a diverse set of people in the room, but we also need people who can ask questions like, “Here is what I see in the data. What problematic things can come up because of that?” It’s a hard problem to solve. You can take the race column out of the data to try and render the algorithm race blind, but algorithms can quickly relearn these biases through proxies and correlates for things like race or gender in the data. If the data we’re feeding in is already biased and we don’t put safeguards in place to protect against bias, we can con ourselves into believe the algorithm is really fairly and agnostically making decisions.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a diverse field with several branches or subfields, each focusing on different aspects of AI research and applications. Here are some of the prominent branches in AI
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: larger;">
                <li><b>Machine Learning (ML) :</b> <br>Machine learning is a fundamental subfield of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) :</b> <br>NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It's used in applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, language translation, and text summarization.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning :</b> <br>This branch of AI focuses on how to represent knowledge in a format that machines can understand and reason with. It's essential for creating systems that can perform logical reasoning and problem-solving.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Robotics :</b> <br>Robotics combines AI with mechanical engineering to create intelligent machines capable of interacting with the physical world. Robots are used in manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and various other industries.</li>
